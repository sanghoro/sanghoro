### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Hello! My name is Seong, a front-end software developer passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. Coming from a background as a US Army veteran and having worked in both behavioral health and entertainment technology, I have a unique approach to web development. I love using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve problems and build cool things!

I'd love to connect and explore how we can collaborate to craft impactful digital solutions!
